## v1.0.0 â€“ 2025-06-14

- Initial release

### Features
- **Project Structure Creation**:  
  Instantly creates a new project folder with standard root folders (`docs`, `source`, `export`) and fixed subfolder structure under `source`:
  - `scenes`
  - `textures`
  - `textures/hdri`
  - `assets`

- **Custom Folder Support**:  
  Allows adding any number of additional folders (including subfolders) via a single input field.  
  Supports batch creation (e.g., `textures/wood*metal*plastic` creates three subfolders inside `textures`).
